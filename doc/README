                            Documentation







1. METAINFORMATION

   In this directory you will find the documentation for the Perl HBM
   package.

   The current version of the documentation is not complete and you will
   hit dead ends.


2. INSTRUCTIONS

   To see the documentation you will need to configure your HB daemon,
   authorizing it to parse the files in this directory.

   You can also use the perlhbm.cgi script to run HB via CGI. You'll
   probably want to edit the first line in that file to have it point
   to the place where your HB binary can be found.

   Finally, you may also check the online version of the documentation
   at the following URL:

       <http://bachue.com/hb/perl>

3. CREDITS

   The documentation for the Perl HBM was written by Alejandro Forero
   Cuervo <bachue@bachue.com>. No contributions have been received from
   other parties.
